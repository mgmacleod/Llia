             The Graph is a window used to interconnect, or patch, synths together. It
            is accessed by the rightmost tab on the main application window.  The image
            below shows a new graph before any synths have been added.</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_000.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            The large window to the right is the graph proper.  The blank area on
            the left is for information.  As the mouse moves over graph icons,
            information about them are displayed in this area.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            Initially the graph contains 2 vertical columns.  The column on
            the left, with labels in_0, in_1, in_2, etc, are audio input buses.  Buses
            in_0 and in_1 are the left and right inputs to the primary sound card.  The
            additional inputs are only connected if the system has additional inputs.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            Similarly the right column represents outputs to the sound card.  out_0
            and out_1 are the primary left and right outputs of the primary sound
            card.  The additional outputs are only connected if they are present on the
            sound card.</p>
            
            <p class="footnote">
            Llia was developed on a system with a single set of stereo inputs and
            outputs.  The connectivity of the additional buses has not been
            verified. </p>

            <p class="section-body">
            For illustration we'll process the MASA organ through a flanger and then
            reverb.   From the Effects tab select and add first the <em>Rumklang</em>
            reverb and then the <em>Flngr</em> effects.</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_001.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            Now switch to the Synths tab and add a MASA organ.</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_002.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            When new items are added to the graph they are initially placed at random
            locations, however they may be freely dragged to new locations.  Initially
            the graph should look something like this.  The two effects are connected
            to both input and output buses and MASA has a single output connected to
            the out_0 bus.</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_003.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            At this point MASA should be active on MIDI channel 1 but it has not yet
            been connected to the effects.   To make the connections we need to create
            two audio buses using the +Audio button near the top.  As with synths,
            the initial position of bus icons is random.  After adding the buses the
            graph should look something like this:</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_004.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            It does not matter which bus is used for the connections and after dragging
            things around a bit the graph now like this:</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_005.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            Audio outputs appear as small circles (or ports) on the upper right hand
            side of synth icons.   Notice that as the mouse enters one of these ports
            it is highlighted and all other ports to which it may connect are also
            highlighted.  The info area is also updated to show information about the
            specific port.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            Drag a line from the output port of MASA to the input (left side) port
            of bus A0.</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_006.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            Now make the additional connections to the flanger and reverb.  Notice
            that when a synth port is connected to a bus it's previous connection is
            severed.</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_007.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            At this point you should have a flanged and reverberated organ,  however
            the initial flanger and reverb programs are set to bypass. To change this go
            to the <a href="group.html">group window</a>, select the Flgr and Rumklang
            tabs, and select one of the available programs.</p>

        <h4 class="heading">Controllers</h4>
            <p class="section-body">
            It may be that we wish to have the organ vibrato synced to the flanger.
            We can do this using an LFO control synth.   Control synths are added and
            connected much the same way as audio synths except that <em>Control</em>
            buses are used.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            From the <em>Controllers</em> tab of the main window add a copy of
            LFO1.</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_009.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            Back on the Graph window click &#34;+Control&#34; to add a new control
            bus.</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_010.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            Control output ports are located at the top of icons with inputs on the
            bottom.  Control buses have a circular appearance instead of the chevron shape of audio
            buses.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            Notice that LFO1 has several outputs, this is because in reality it is
            three LFOs in one. You can use the info area while mousing over the output
            ports to determine which one you want.  At times the port names may be
            cryptic, for this case we want the &#34;outbus&#34; port.  Drag a
            connection from the outbus port of LFO1 to the input port of the control
            bus.   Now drag another line from the top of the control bus to the
            control input of MASA.  Finally drag a line from the control bus to an
            input port on the flanger.  The flanger has two control inputs, select the
            one on the left called &#34;delaybus&#34;.   The graph should look
            something like this:</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_011.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            If you now play this patch there will probably be no difference.  The
            reason is most synth programs have external control turned off by default.
            You can fix this by visiting the synth editors back on the Group window.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            The terminology may not be consistent between different synth
            types. For the flanger adjust the "External" slider, For MASA, use the
            "Scale" slider located in the External section.</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/graph/graph_012.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            Notice though that the flanger has a control output for it's internal
            LFO.  We could have used it instead of LFO1 to achieve much the same
            effect.  It is not as flexible as LFO1 but if all you need is a
            simple sine wave it would be the better choice.</p>
