        <h4 class="heading">Synths</h4>
             
            There are three types of client-side synths:
            <ol>
               <li>Instruments</li>
               <li>Effects</li>
               <li>Controllers</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Technically these are instances of the Python <em>SynthProxy</em> class. There
            are also server-side synths running within SuperCollider.  We are rarely
            directly concerned with the server side synths and unless otherwise noted
            the term &#34;synth&#34; refers to a client object.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            The order in which synths are created is significant.  In general an effect
            must be created <em>prior</em> to anything which serves as it's inputs.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
             
            If you wish to process an organ through a flanger and then a
            reverb, the reverb must be created first, then the flanger and finally the organ.</p>
            
            <pre class="code">
    
       [organ]--&gt;[flanger]--&gt;[reverb]--&gt;
    
            </pre>
            
            Creation Order:
            <ol>
              <li>Reverb</li>
              <li>Flanger</li>
              <li>Organ</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="footnote">
            
            As always there is an exception.  Instruments which use the <em>Poly1</em> 
            <a href="keymode.html">keymode</a> may be created at any time.  This is
            because Poly1 creates server-side synths on the fly which are therefore
            always newer the any other synth.  This trick only works while using
            Poly1. </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Control synths either generate or process control rate signals, and never
            directly process audio.  The instrument and effect synths generate and/or
            receive audio rate signals.  They may also receive control rate
            signals and in some cases generate control signals.   Effects such as
            flangers often have internal LFOs or other control generates. These are
            often provided as control outputs of the effect.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            The creation order for controller synths is not important, though there
            may be subtle differences.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Synths are &#34;patched&#34; together using <em>buses</em> in the 
            <a href="graph.html">Graph</a> window.  There are two types of buses:
            </p>
            
            
            <ol>
              <li>Audio Buses</li>
              <li>Control Buses</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="section-body">
            
            A bus may be connected to any number of inputs and outputs.  The same is
            not true for synths, each synth input/output may only connect to a single
            bus.</p>
