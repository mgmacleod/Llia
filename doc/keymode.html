            Each active synth has an associated keymode which manages how the synth
            responds to MIDI key events. Not every synth type is compatible with every
            keymode.

            Currently there are six keymodes,  each with it's own set of pros and cons.
            Additional keymodes may be added later.

            <b>PolyN</b> is the default keymode.  It instantiates a fixed number of voices
            ahead of time and then allocates them to play notes as needed.  If the number
            of keys down exceeds the voice count then some previous notes will be stolen.
            When a new key down is received, PolyN first tries to use an un-allocated 
            voice.  If all voices are currently in use it steals the voice which has 
            been held down the longest.</p>
            
            
            <p>Pros:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Fast, no need to create synths on the fly.</li>
               <li>Fixed resource load.</li>
               <li>Portamento supported (in a fashion).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cons:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Limited polyphony, voices are stolen if notes played exceeds voice count.</li>

            <p class="section-body">
            
            <b>PolyRotate</b> is similar to PolyN except that it allocates voices in strict
            rotation.  In most cases PolyN is the better choice.   PolyRotate shares the 
            same set of pros and cons as PolyN.</p>

            <b>Poly1</b> instantiates synths on the fly as required for incoming 
            key events.  The synths are destroyed once their key has been lifted and all
            envelopes have terminated.</p>
            
            
            <p>Pros:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple</li>
                <li>Up to 128 note polyphony (if resources are available).</li>
                <li>May be used with any effects chain without regard to synth creation order.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complex synths may take too long to create on the fly.</li>
                <li>Resource heavy if too many notes held, particularly with complex
                    synths or long decay tails.</li>
                <li>Effects which require some history between notes, such as portamento, 
                    do not work.</li>

            <b>Mono1</b> is a monophonic keymode with last note priority.  A single
            persistent server side synth object is created.

            <b>MonoExclusive</b> is a highly specialized keymode where only
            the initial key down is articulated. Once a key is down, 
            additional keys are ignored until all keys have been lifted.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
             
            The intended use is to layer MonoExclusive with another keymode.  This
            allows the first note of a legato passage to have an alternate or accented
            tone.  A real world example is on certain antique electric organs where a
            click is produced only on initial key presses.</p>

            <p class="section-body">
            
            <b>Efx</b> is a specialized keymode for effects and control synths.   As
            with mono mode a single persistent server side synth object is created. 
            Efx mode passes the last keynumber, note frequency, and velocity to the
            effect, should it be interested. 
            
            
            As long as any key is down the gate signal is high,  if all keys
            are up the gate signal goes low.
