            Llia supports a comprehensive MIDI implementation.  All MIDI channel
            events, with the exception of polyphonic after touch and release velocity,
            are supported. There is an extensive mapping facility for translating MIDI
            data to synth parameters.  Velocity, channel-pressure, pitch-bend,
            continuous controllers and MIDI key numbers may be mapped to any synth
            parameter.  Each source may map to several parameters simultaneously, each
            with it's own set of range and transfer functions.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            Each active synth has a dedicated bank of up to 128 programs.
            Each program stores specific patch values as well as most MIDI parameters.
            For example the modulation wheel may be mapped to vibrato for program 1 and
            to filter cutoff for program 2.  The set of MIDI parameters within a
            program are called a <em>Performance</em>.  Performances have identical
            structure across all Llia synths. It is possible to copy a performance from
            one synth into another, even if they are of different types.  Any mapped
            parameters which are present for the source synth but missing in the
            destination are ignored.   Identical performances may also be copied across
            several program bank slots.</p>

            MIDI and performance parameters are accessed by the MIDI, Map1 and Map2

        <h4 class="heading">The MIDI tab</h4>
            <p class="section-body">
            The MIDI tab contains both performance and non-performance values.  The
            non-performance values (MIDI channel and Key Table) are not saved as part
            of a performance.   All other parameters are saved as part of a Performance
            and may be different for each selected program.</p>
            
            
            <ul>
              <li><b>MIDI Input Channel.</b>  Not much to be said here, select an input channel.</li>
              <li><b>Key Table.</b> Selects one of the available key tables for alternate tuning.<br>
                   Currently there is no way for the user to define their own tables. The tables on offer are all tuned to A440 and fall into two general classes:
                <ol>
                  <li>Equal tempered scales are named "EQn", where n is the number of notes per octave.</li>
                  <li>Most of the other scales use some kind of just intonations.  Many of these scales 
                      are defined <a href="http://xenharmonic.wikispaces.com/Gallery+of+12-tone+Just+Intonation+Scales">here</a>.</li>
                </ol>
            <li><b>Transpose.</b> Transpose key number by up to 36 half-steps.</li>
            <li><b>Key Range.</b> Sets range of key number this synth responds to.  Any transposition is applied after the key-range test.</li>
            <li><b>Bend Range.</b> Sets pitch bend range in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music)">cents.</a></li>
            </ul>
        <h4 class="heading">Map 1 and Map 2 tabs</h4>
        <img class="center" src="images/midi/midi_001.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            
            The contents of the Map1 and Map2 tabs are nearly identical.  The only
            differences are the types of MIDI data they contain.   Map1
            has controls for Continuous Controller and Pitch Wheel.  Map2 contains
            mapping controls for Velocity, Aftertouch and Keynumber.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Adding or removing a map is (nearly) the same for all types of MIDI data.
            Continuous controller maps have an additional parameter to set the controller
            number, but otherwise is identical to the other data types.</p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            To add a map click the [+] button in the appropriate section, which brings
            up new dialog to set mapping parameters.</p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/midi/midi_002.png" alt="" />
            
            <ul>
               <li><b>Controller Number</b>,   Selects MIDI controller number (for controller maps only).</li>
               <li><b>Params</b>,  Selects the synth parameter to send the MIDI data to.
                   Parameters are listed in alphabetical order and at times may be
                   cryptic. The parameters in this list do not necessarily match the
                   label for the corresponding editor control.   You can determine the
                   proper parameter name by mousing over an editor control.  The name and
                   current value appears in the status line at the bottom of the editor
                   window.</li>
               <li><b>Curve</b>,  Selects the transfer curve.</li> 
               <li><b>Modifier</b>,  is a coefficient which alters the curve steepness.
            It has no effect for the linear curve.  For the exponential curve it
            influences the curve degree and and changes the concavity. Positive and
            negative values alternately produce concave and convex curves.   For the
            step curve the modifier sets the number of steps.  If the modifier is
            negative the end points are included in the step curve.</li>
            
            <li><b>Range</b>,  sets the range of mapped values. With exception of pitch
            bend each controller generates a value between 0 and 1. Pitch bend is
            signed and produces values between -1 and +1.  When mapping key numbers,
            the lowest key in the key-range produces 0, the highest key produces 1.
            Keys outside the key range are clipped to either 0 or 1. <br>
            
            The Range Low and High values set the range of values sent to the synth
            parameter.  If these values are inverted, such that Low&gt;High, then the
            mapping curve is inverted.</li>
            <li><b>Limit</b>, sets an absolute maximum/minimum for the mapped values.
            Care should be taken the the limit is not unintentionally restricting the
            resulting values.</li>
            </ul>
