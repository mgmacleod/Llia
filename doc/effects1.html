            An effect is a special type of <a
            href="glossary.html#synth">synth</a> for processing audio signals.  The
            input may come from another synth or from an external source via 
            the sound card.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            To use an effect a synth's output is <em>patched</em> to the
            effects input.  This patching is not done directly, instead 
            an <em>audio bus</em> is used to connect the two synths together.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            You may assign buses when a synth is created but it is more intuitive to use
            the &#34;graph&#34; window which graphically displays the interconnection
            between synths and buses.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            For illustration we'll patch the MASA organ through the Rumklang reverb. 
            To start with a clean slate, select the restart option of the File menu.

            The graph shows several things,  First though, when items are
            initially placed on the graph they are at random locations. Click 
            and drag the icons around as you please.

            <p class="section-body">
            
            There are two synth icons, one for MASA and one for Rumklang.  MASA is connected to
            something called out_0, Rumklang is connected to out_0, out_1 and in_0.
            These things the synths are connected to are audio buses, but these are
            special buses related to hardware input and output.  
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            The column of buses on the right are hardware outputs.  Buses out_0 and
            out_1 corresponds to the primary Left and Right outputs of the first
            sound card.  The remaining buses corresponds to additional outputs or to 
            additional sound cards. If the system does not have additional outputs,
            these buses are not connected to anything. 
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            Likewise the left column are hardware inputs.  Buses in_0
            and in_1 are the left and right inputs of the primary sound card.  Additional
            inputs or sound cards, if any, are connected to the remaining buses.
            </p>
            
            <p class="section-body">
            
            In order to process MASA through the reverb a new, general, audio bus must
            be created.
            </p>
            
            
            <ol start="8">
               <li>Click +Audio and a new bus appears at some random location.</li>

            <p class="section-body">
            
            Look closely at the MASA icon and find the small circle near the top on the
            right hand side.  This is the main output for the synth.  MASA only has a
            single output, others synths may have several.  Whenever you move the mouse
            into one of these circles, all of the places to which it may connect are
            highlighted.
            </p>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/efx1/efx011.png" alt="" />
            
            <ol start="9">
                <li>Drag a line between the output of MASA to the input (left side) of audio
                 bus A0.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
        <img class="center" src="images/efx1/efx012.png" alt="" />
            <p class="section-body">
            
            When you release the mouse the connection between MASA and A0 is made, and the previous connection
            between MASA and out_0 is severed.  A synth output may only connect to a
            single bus.  A bus however may be connected to any number of synths.

               At this point there is no path between MASA and the sound card.

              <li>In a similar manner connect the right side of bus A0 to the input
